    <h2>My Love,</h2>
    <p>
        It's hard to believe that time has passed so quickly since we first met. Every moment with you has been a gift—one I will treasure forever. I still remember the first time we chat where I'm the one who make a first move, the way your smile made everything around us fade and how I felt like I had known you my entire life. <br /><br />
        You’ve filled my life with so much love, laughter and memories I hold close to my heart. You are my best friend, my confidant and the person I want to spend the rest of my days with which I can oly pray that we'll last together. No matter what happens, I will always be grateful for everything you’ve given me. Big apologizes when I always prioritize my ego, it's not that I'm not afraid of losing you but I'm afraid of being left when I fall so hard. I'm in love with you deeply, I genuinely love you no matter who you are. I'm deeply sorry for my attitude that always hurt you though you always say "It's fine" when it is actually not fine to you. <br /><br />
        It just feel so wrong if we never fight like I felt like we're going to path away no matter what happen and that's why I think that we need to fight sometimes. <br /><br />
        Our journey together has been full of joy and even challenges but with you by my side, I’ve learned to embrace everything that comes our way. I’m so thankful that we have each other and I can't wait to create even more beautiful memories. <br /><br />
        You are my forever and I love you more than words can express.
    </p>
    <p>With all my heart,</p>
    <p>Your Emmi</p>
